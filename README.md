Top 2-3 Transportation & Smart Mobility Ideas:
    
    1. Parking Finder
          Problem: Drivers waste time searching for parking.
          Idea: AI recommends available parking spots in real time.
          AI Approach: Image recognition from cameras to detect open parking spots
          Target Users: City drivers, shoppers, event attendees, etc.  
    
    2. Traffic Predictor
          Problem: Drivers get stuck in traffic and waste time.
          Idea: AI predicts traffic congestion using traffic data
          AI Approach: Regression model to predict traffic flow
          Target Users: Drivers who don't want to get caught in traffic
    
    3. Route Planner
          Problem: Drivers take routes that are often longer than another route, wasting time in the process.
          Idea: AI suggests routes that minimize drive time. 
          AI Approach: Regression models on traffic and speed of routes
          Target Users: Drivers who want to reduce drive time.

Finalized Product Idea:
      Parking Finder App:
          Problem: Drivers waste time searching for parking.
          Idea: AI recommends available parking spots in real time.
          AI Approach: Image recognition from cameras to detect open parking spots
          Target Users: City drivers, shoppers, event attendees, etc.
