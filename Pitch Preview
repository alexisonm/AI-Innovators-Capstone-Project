Hello, we’re presenting our Smart Parking Finder app. The problem we’re solving is simple: drivers waste time and fuel searching for parking in busy areas. 
Our solution is an AI-powered mobile app that uses image recognition from street and lot cameras to detect open spots in real time. 
The app shows available spaces on a clean dashboard, sends notifications, and even predicts peak parking times. 
Our target users include city drivers, shoppers, and event-goers. 
We’ve designed the app with responsible AI in mind — no personal data is collected, and predictions are built to work fairly across all neighborhoods. 
We’ve started building mockups and structuring our pitch deck, and everything is documented in our GitHub repo. Thanks for listening! We’re excited to keep building!
