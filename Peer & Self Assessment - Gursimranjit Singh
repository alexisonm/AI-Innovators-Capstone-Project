Self-Assessment

In this project, I lead our video pitch, logo and final presentation. I worked to 
make sure we were ready and that our Smart Parking Finder idea was explained in a clear and 
simple way. I also helped plan the structure of the video to make it look polished and keep 
people interested. Taking charge of this part let me make sure our group's hard work was 
shown in the best light.

I stayed focused on this job and worked with my teammates to get what we needed for the 
video. Being the main presenter helped me get better at speaking about our project with 
confidence.

Overall, I think leading the presentation was an important part of our project's success. We 
tried to tell our project's story in a way that was easy to follow and engaging. If we had more 
time, I would have liked to practice the pitch a few more times to make it even smoother.

Peer Assessment

My group members contributed strongly and consistently, and we worked well together.

Danny took full responsibility for the slide deck and made sure it was clean, organized, and 
aligned with our innovation idea. They kept us updated with their work and were open to 
suggestions, which helped match the message we wanted to deliver.

Meanwhile, Alexis took the lead on organizing the team from the start, helping everyone 
understand our tasks and timeline. They introduced our initial project idea and made sure it 
was something we could realistically complete. To keep things moving, they helped assign roles 
so that everyone had a clear responsibility. Throughout the project, they stayed engaged, 
checked in regularly, and adjusted plans based on team feedback to keep us working smoothly.

As a team, we communicated respectfully and stayed understanding of each other’s schedules 
(this definitely was a big part), ideas, and work styles. We made decisions together and 
supported the parts each person was responsible for. Everyone put in effort and stayed on top 
of the group’s goals, the project came together efficiently and was a true capstone project.
